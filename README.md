# AFNI-Pipeline
AFNI pipeline I use for most basic fMRI analyses

## TO-DOs:
- generalize filename for niftis to be moved into raw_nii
- restructure filepath sets and calls in conversion script
- Add support for producing scripts that don't run regression
- Add support for different block types by regressor
